Library Management System – Project Plan


1. Project Overview
 
 	-The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage books, authors, and readers while tracking borrowing activities and maintaining data integrity. 
The system uses a modular structure with database handling, service logic, and core entity classes separated for clean architecture.

2. Core Features

   1.Reader Management

       - Register new readers with constraints (ID, Name, Age, Gender).

       - Validate duplicate IDs before registration.

       - Store reader data in a MySQL database.
   2.Book Management
 
       - Add new books with availability status.

       - Link books to authors for ownership tracking.

       - Display available books when borrowing.

   3. Borrowing & Returning

       - Borrow books only if available.

       - Return books and update availability.

       - Track which reader borrowed which book.


3. System Architecture
 
      - Entities: Reader, Book, Author.
 
      - Database Layer: Handles all SQL operations and ensures data integrity.

      - Service Layer: Implements business logic (borrowing, returning, statistics).

      - Main Application: Menu-driven interface for user interactions.

4. Error Handling

      - Validates user inputs for type and constraints.

      - Handles SQL errors (e.g., duplicate IDs, incorrect data types).

      - Graceful handling of unavailable books during borrowing.
